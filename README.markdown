Simple site generation code for my static homepage, all credit to 
[maciakl](https://github.com/maciakl) for the his simple sample Jekyll site and
Twitter Bootstrap for the awesome responsive layout.

Please feel free to use this as a starting point, though I would ask to not re-use the blog posts.
