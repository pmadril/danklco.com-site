<p>My typical workflow for developing with AEM frequently involves reading from logs. &nbsp;Whether it's for checking if bundles and services installed, following the logging of custom code or trying to get a full stack trace of an error, the logs provided by AEM are an invaluable tool. &nbsp;Until now, this has meant switching back and forth between my IDE (Eclipse) and the terminal. &nbsp;Dual monitors and&nbsp;<a href="http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/" target="_blank">Total Terminal</a>&nbsp;help, but it's still not as efficient as it could be to keep switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Last week, I decided to see if this was a way to make this better. &nbsp;The most obvious solution was to make my logs visible inside Eclipse, so I started looking at the Eclipse Marketplace. &nbsp;There are&nbsp;<a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/search/site/log" target="_blank">a number of plugins</a>, and after some testing, I settled on <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/logviewer" target="_blank">LogViewer</a>&nbsp;as it was fairly simple, but had all of the features I wanted.</p>
<h2>Installing LogViewer</h2>
<p>Installing LogViewer is pretty simple as it's available in the Eclipse Marketplace. &nbsp;Simply search for LogViewer and follow the wizard through the installation. &nbsp;Make sure to accept that you are installing unsigned code and then restart Eclipse when the installation is complete.</p>

<h2>Adding LogViewer</h2>
<p>Once you have LogViewer installed and Eclipse has restarted, you can add it to you perspective. &nbsp;Simply go to&nbsp;<em>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other...</em> to locate the LogViewer view and then add it to your perspective where ever makes sense for you. &nbsp;I would suggest the bottom viewport. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Configuring LogViewer</h2>
<p>Once you have LogViewer installed and added to your perspective, you can configure it. &nbsp;First, select the&nbsp;<em>Open Logfile</em> button to select the logs to tail.</p>

<p>Next, go ahead and add some line highlighting to highlight errors and warnings, simply select the&nbsp;<em>Show rule preferences</em> button. &nbsp;This will open the preferences dialog to set up line highlighting.</p>

<p>Adding rules is simple and log viewer supports several different modes of searching including regular expressions and word matching. &nbsp;Once you have all this configured, sit back and enjoy viewing your logs without leaving Eclipse:</p>
