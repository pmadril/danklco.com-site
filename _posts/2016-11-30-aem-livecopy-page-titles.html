<p>In my <a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/adobe/2016/02/23/web-maintenance-a-chore-aem-live-copy-to-the-rescue/" target="_blank">previous post</a>&nbsp;about <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/administer/sites/msm.html" target="_blank">AEM LiveCopy</a>, I showed how this powerful tool could be used to manage multiple variant-based sites such as dealer or branch sites. Recently, I found another trick which can help make LiveCopy even more powerful and easy to use.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Isn't My Title Updating??</h3>
<p>By default, AEM excludes certain properties from the live copy update and initial rollout. During a recent implementation, I encountered an issue where the client wanted to be able to roll out <code>jcr:title</code> updates from one master language copy to the regional websites. Unfortunately, by default, AEM excludes all <code>jcr:</code>&nbsp;properties, including <code>jcr:title</code> from LiveCopy updates.</p>
<p>
    Luckily, an OSGi configuration controls which properties are to be excluded, which allows you to easily update this setting on your AEM instance.
</p>
<h3>Updating jcr:title with AEM LiveCopy</h3>
<p>The solution to this problem was to create an OSGi configuration with the name <code>com.day.cq.wcm.msm.impl.actions.ContentUpdateActionFactory.config</code> in our <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/5-6-1/deploying/configuring_osgi.html#OSGi Configuration in the Repository" target="_blank">application's configuration folder</a>. This configuration is based on the default configuration, but instructs AEM to NOT ignore the <code>jcr:title</code> and <code>cq:tags</code> properties by added them into a regular expression used by AEM to determine which properties should be excluded in the <code>cq.wcm.msm.action.excludedprops</code> property:</p>
<pre><code># Custom configuration to enable the live copying of jcr:title and cq:tags<br />cq.wcm.msm.action.excludednodetypes=["cq:LiveSyncConfig","cq:BlueprintSyncConfig","cq:LiveSyncAction","cq:CatalogSyncConfig","cq:CatalogSyncAction","cq:meta"]<br />cq.wcm.msm.action.excludedparagraphitems=["cq:propertyInheritanceCancelled"]<br />cq.wcm.msm.action.ignoredMixin=[".*"]<br />cq.wcm.msm.action.excludedprops=["jcr:(<em>?!(title)$</em>).*","sling:(?!(resourceType|resourceSuperType)$).*","cq:(?!(designPath|template|lastTranslationUpdate|targetEngine|<em>tags</em>)$).*","publishCampaignId"]</code></pre>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>cq.wcm.msm.action.excludedprops</code> property is a list of regular expressions, with each being checked against the property name to determine whether or not the property should be updated. In this case, the regular expression <code>jcr:(?!(title)$).*</code> uses lookbacks to exclude every <code>jcr:</code> property besides <code>jcr:title</code>.</p>
<h3>Excluding Custom Properties</h3>
<p>
    If you need to exclude custom properties from LiveCopy updates, you can also use this same feature. By setting a regular expression which excludes your property in  <code>cq.wcm.msm.action.excludedprops</code>, allows you to easily exclude a custom property in LiveCopy rollout updates.
