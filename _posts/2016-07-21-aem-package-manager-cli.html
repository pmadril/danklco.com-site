<p>After the umpteenth time of having to check&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/2916697">this excellent reference</a>&nbsp;of the cURL commands for AEM to upload a package, I finally thought "this is silly" and created a small script to make it easier.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/PerficientDigital/AEM-Package-Manager">AEM Package Manager</a>&nbsp;is just that, a small script to help you manage scripts from the command line. This can be useful when you are exchanging content packages, need to install a dependency package outside the build or you just want something quicker and easier than using the AEM web UI to upload a package.</p>
<p>Using the script is as simple as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading the script from GitHub</li>
<li>Making it executable</li>
<li>Putting it in your system path</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the script installed, you can use it as shown in the following examples:</p>
<p>aem-pkmgr list -g my_packages</p>
<p>List all of the packages in the <em>my_packages</em> group.</p>
