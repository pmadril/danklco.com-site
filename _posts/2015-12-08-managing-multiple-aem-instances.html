<p>One of the challenges I've had over the last few years is how to easily manage multiple AEM instances concurrently. Over the last few years, I've often had to have several instances running during the course of the day, whether it be different versions, client codebases or for just for standing up a quick test.</p>
<p>To enable this and to allow me to easily start, stop and reset AEM instances I created a small script and&nbsp;created a structure to support easily managing multiple AEM instances on the same computer. First, from a structure perspective I create the following folders:</p>
<pre>/[user-home]
    /dev
        /aem
            /instance1
            /instance2

This also allows me to add other applications in parallel, such as MongoDB, Tomcat or anything else with which I may need to integrate.</p>
