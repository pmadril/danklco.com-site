<p>Just as the&nbsp;promise of technology in marketing is undeniable, so are the challenges facing many companies in integrating technology into their marketing. In many organizations, marketing isn't coming close to their potential in digital marketing, frequently due to&nbsp;technological obstacles, whether internal or external.</p>
<h2>Technology Obstacles</h2>
<p>Some of the common digital marketing obstacles&nbsp;we see working with our clients are:</p>
<h3>Disappointing&nbsp;Customer Experiences</h3>
<p>As technology as become faster, cheaper and more ubiquitous, consumers are increasingly using technology in their daily lives and marketers are being challenged to meet&nbsp;customer's increasing expectations. Over the last few years, user interface design, the level of personalization in every day interactions and the "smart" device revolution have drastically increased consumer's expectations of how they will interact with technology. When your competitors or even companies like Google and Apple have a significantly better experience than you do, customers will not longer wait for you to adapt, they move on.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you, your team or your IT department is doing, in order to market effectively to and to retain clients, you will need to meet their expectations. Many IT organizations are especially behind on this regard as their preference is for features and functionality over UX and customer experience.</p>
<h3>Disjointed Customer Experiences</h3>
<p>One of the worst sins of User Experience is surprising your user according to the <a href="http://www.uxpassion.com/blog/the-principle-of-least-surprise/" target="_blank">Principal&nbsp;of Least Surprise</a>. When users arbitrarily cross between different segments of your digital marketing and receive noticeably different experiences, this is jarring and off-putting. I'm sure we've all had experiences where going from a company's marketing website to their E-Commerce website is like crossing from the modern era back to the early 90's or where you can order online, but getting support requires actually calling someone. Providing an inconsistent experience and messaging during&nbsp;a customer's interactions causes&nbsp;user confusion and frustration.</p>
<h3>Data Fragmentation</h3>
<p>Another disjointed technological problem is fragmented data. If you provide a consistent UX, but don't gather the right data consistently or store data where it cannot be easily accessed, it's difficult to provide a personalized, truly consistent experience and nearly impossible to properly measure and optimize a user's journey.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Channel&nbsp;Overload</h3>
<p>Email, Print, Mobile, Desktop, Social, TV, there are so many potential ways to reach consumers and due to the fragmentation in many company's data it's even more difficult to understand who a person is across multiple channels. With the immense proliferation of engagement channels, there have never been more ways or more choices and confusion on how to reach consumers. Further complicating the situation, these different channels have very different engagement and measurement characteristics and interfaces.</p>
<h2>Technology Solutions</h2>
<p>So how do you transform&nbsp;your Technology Obstacles into Technology Solutions?</p>
<h3>Embrace Digital Marketing</h3>
<p>Many companies only dip a toe into Digital Marketing or artificially silo it off from the rest of marketing. Technology and digital experiences are now so woven into daily marketing activities, there is really no true differentiation, so bring it into the fold!</p>
<p>This includes the technology behind the marketing as well. A good marketing department works with IT and ensures it has the expertise to intelligently evaluate IT solutions and propose reasonable compromises. By getting away from an Us vs. Them methodology and truly embracing Digital Marketing you can be more effective and reduce the internal churn and conflict. Now all that's left is to decide who owns the budget...</p>
<h3>Bring in the Experts</h3>
<p>Some companies try to build everything with their&nbsp;internal team. While having experts on staff can certainly help increase project success and reduce costs, your company probably isn't Amazon, a digital marketing agency or a technology integrator. Bring experts to lead the charge, and make sure to integrate your team so you can support, maintain and expand. Keeping a balance between the extremes of outsourcing everything and doing it all in house allows you to build your own internal expertise without creating stagnation and internal bloat.</p>
<h3>Good Enough Beats&nbsp;Perfect</h3>
<p>A good thing, which launches on time is better than the "perfect" solution which never launches. A problem I've witnessed over and over again is the perfectly integrated, infinitely scalable solution that no one really understands and really isn't used. Keep things simple and follow a crawl, walk, run method of continuous improvement to get yourself started, make improvements and eventually get to where you want to be.</p>
<p>Choosing, simple to use, integrated solutions will enable quicker adoption within your team versus complex proprietary tools which have a steep learning curve and often a number of features no one will ever use. Furthermore, getting a good solution out there will&nbsp;satisfy customers quicker than a long wait for your overly complex mega-solution.</p>
<h3>Be Open, Not Closed</h3>
<p>Be open! Use open source and open standards. Embrace integration-based solutions versus closed solutions. Open solutions allow for a more agile, organic growth and lower costs when integrating with existing systems. Open does not mean that a vendor can't offer integrated solutions, but the best integrated solutions leverage open standards and can be integrated with third parties.</p>
<p>Finally, talk openly&nbsp;with customers and other team members and look for feedback.</p>
