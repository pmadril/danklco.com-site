<p>Last month, Adobe <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/release-notes.html" target="_blank">released AEM 6.2</a>, the latest iteration of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/enterprise-content-management.html" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Manager</a>, Adobe's flagship Web Experience Management product. This new release comes with some <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/digital-marketing/adobe-experience-manager-6-2-new-features/" target="_blank">exciting new features</a>&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Template Editor</li>
<li>Smart Tags</li>
<li>Asset Insights</li>
<li>AEM Mobile</li>
<li>Community Insights &amp; Scoring</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most exiciting features for me is the latest and greatest integration with Adobe Target for Personalization and Optimization. This new itegration provides a much deeper integration between the authoring and content management features of Adobe Experience Manager and the powerful personalization and optimization features of Adobe Target.</p>
<p>While at Adobe Summit, I attended the Lab <em>"Integrating Experience Manager with Adobe Analytics, Target and DTM"</em>, this lab showed the new integration between AEM and Target. In only one hour, we were able to set up all four products and integrate them together into a cohesive solution to personalize content.</p>
