<p>Last month, Adobe <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/release-notes.html" target="_blank">released AEM 6.2</a>, the latest iteration of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/enterprise-content-management.html" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Manager</a>, Adobe's flagship Web Experience Management product. This new release comes with some <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/digital-marketing/adobe-experience-manager-6-2-new-features/" target="_blank">exciting new features</a>&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Template Editor</li>
<li>Smart Tags</li>
<li>Asset Insights</li>
<li>AEM Mobile</li>
<li>Community Insights &amp; Scoring</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most exciting features for me is the latest and greatest integration with Adobe Target for Personalization and Optimization. This new itegration provides a much deeper integration between the authoring and content management features of Adobe Experience Manager and the powerful personalization and optimization features of Adobe Target.</p>
<p>This interation allows for marketers to manange and author content to be targeted through the familiar and user-friendly AEM interface reduces the number of tools the average user will need to use and be familiar with in order to do their job. Given the <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/personalization/personalization-payoff-roi-getting-personal/" target="_blank">clear benefits of personalization and optimization</a>&nbsp;and the improvements Adobe has made in improving the user interface and friendlyness of the AEM / Target integration, I expect more implementations will start leveraging both tools, especially when implementing AEM 6.2.</p>
<h3>Seeing the Integration</h3>
<p>While at Adobe Summit, I attended the Lab <em>"Integrating Experience Manager with Adobe Analytics, Target and DTM"</em>, this lab showed the new integration between AEM and Target. In only one hour, we were able to set up all four products and integrate them together into a cohesive solution to personalize content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, I'll show the process for using the integration. For more information on setting up or configuring the AEM / Target integration, please see the <a href="https://adobesummit.lanyonevents.com/2016/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1462" target="_blank">Summit Session documents</a>.</p>
<h4>1. Configure the Activity in AEM</h4>
<p>The first step to using Adobe Target in AEM is to configure your Activity. An activity is an instance of targeting on a page. Each activity gets a name and you can configure which targeting engine, configuration and targeting type to use.</p>
