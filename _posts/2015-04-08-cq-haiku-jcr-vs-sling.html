<blockquote>Adapt to Node like<br /> Assembly inside Java<br /> Use Sling API</blockquote>
<p>Quite often I see code, especially from less experience developers, with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Node node = resource.adaptTo(Node.class);
String property = null;
try{
    property = node.getProperty("myProperty").getString();
} catch (RepositoryException re){
    log.error("Exception accessing myProperty", re);
}</code></pre>
<p>Or even scarier, there may be just a global exception handler for the particular method. Either way, this code is a lot more fragile than it needs to be. If the property <code>myProperty</code> does not exist this can throw a <code>PathNotFoundException</code> or if there's any other problem it will throw a <code>RepositoryException</code>. You also have to handle multiple null checks and ensuring the property value is the correct type.</p>
<p>The Sling API on the other hand, handles most relevant exceptions by doing things like allowing default values or returning null if no value exists for a particular property. Because of this it is also significantly more concise:</p>
<pre><code>ValueMap properties = resource.adaptTo(ValueMap.class);
String property = properties.get("myProperty", String.class);</code></pre>
<p>In summary, unless you <strong>need</strong> the features available in the JCR API, sticking with the Sling API will make your code more consise and less fragile.</p>
