	Recently, I spent a bit of time running performance tests against various versions of CQ5/AEM 
	to understand the performance characteristics of the different versions.  One of the interesting 
	outcomes of this testing is that CQ 5.6 and before have a very distinct point at which 
	the instance becomes unstable.
</p>
<p>
	To evaluate the performance characteristics of AEM, I used an AWS m4.xLarge EC2 instance
	and Apache Benchmark to simulate traffic against a consistent baseline.  
</p>
<p>
	AEM 6.0 and 6.1 were able to scale up to 1000 concurrent requests without significant errors 
	as illustrated in the graph below:

<p>
	CQ5.6 however ran into serious problems at approximately 400 concurrent requests and 
	experienced a high and increasing error rate as the concurrency continued to increase.

	So why is this the case? In AEM 6.0, Adobe introduce the new

	title="Intro to Jackrabbit OAK">CRX3 repository which is 
	based on Jackrabbit OAK</a>.  This new repository implementation provides significant performance
	improvements over CRX2.

<p>
	I found out a number of other particularities when comparing the performance of CQ 5.6
	and AEM 6.1, for a complete report, including analysis and recommendations:
