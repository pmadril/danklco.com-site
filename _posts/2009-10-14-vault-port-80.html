<p>
	Recently, when using Vault to connect to an Integration server, I started getting an the following error when Vault tried to connect.
</p>
<p>
		[ERROR] import: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Workspace missmatch.
</p>
<p>
	The error, besides being misspelled, was not terribly helpful, but eventually I figured out when using Vault to connect to a repository
	running on port 80, you should not specify the port.&nbsp; Normally, when you you use Vault, you specity the port the server is running on 
	as part of the url, for example: http://localhost:4502/crx/server, however with port 80 this causes an error.
</p>
<p>
	For those not familiar, Vault is a tool provided by Adobe for connecting
	to CQ and CRX repositories.&nbsp; You can read more about it <a href="http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/developmenttools/developing_with_eclipse.html#Installing%20FileVault%20%28VLT%29" target="_blank">here</a>.
