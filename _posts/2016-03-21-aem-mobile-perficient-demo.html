<p>I am very excited to show Perficient's demo for Adobe Summit. We have created a mobile app based on the Adobe Digital Marketing technologies outlined <a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltech/2016/03/07/aem-mobile-part-1-a-fresh-approach-to-mobile-apps/" target="_blank">in my AEM Mobile blog post</a>. This app brings together many parts of Adobe Experience Manager and the Adobe Marketing Cloud to produce a mobile app which can be easily authored by non-technical users. So how did we pull this off?</p>
<h2>Perficient Digital: Design and Front End Coding</h2>
<p>Our process started by leveraging Perficient's strong design capabiities&nbsp;to create the experience based on our branding at Adobe Summit. Olivia, one of our designers created the designs, iterated on the designs with our digital marketing team and then delivered the finished the designs within a single week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, one of our skilled Multi-Solution Architects, Scott, picked up these design comps and translated them into workable HTML wireframes.&nbsp;</p>
