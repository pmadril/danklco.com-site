<p>I am very excited to show Perficient's demo for Adobe Summit. We have created a mobile app based on the Adobe Digital Marketing technologies outlined <a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltech/2016/03/07/aem-mobile-part-1-a-fresh-approach-to-mobile-apps/" target="_blank">in my AEM Mobile blog post</a>. This app brings together many parts of Adobe Experience Manager and the Adobe Marketing Cloud to produce a mobile app which can be easily authored by non-technical users. So how did we pull this off?</p>
<h2>Step 1: Perficient Digital's Design and Front End Coding</h2>
<p>Our process started by leveraging Perficient's strong design capabiities&nbsp;to create the experience based on our branding at Adobe Summit. Olivia, one of our designers created the designs, iterated on the designs with our digital marketing team and then delivered the finished the designs within a single week.</p>

<p>Next, one of our skilled Multi-Solution Architects, Scott, picked up these design comps and translated them into workable HTML wireframes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Step 2: Perficient Digital's&nbsp;AEM Implementation</h2>
<p>Once we had the design created, we implemented the app inside AEM Mobile. Our developers and architects including Anton, Harini and Eddie, implemented this application inside AEM using the Angular framework.</p>

<p>From the AEM interface, authors can easily maintain content, publish content and release the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 3: Perficient Digital's Analytics Implementation</h2>
<p>As the AEM team was completing the app code, Ryan, one of our Analytics experts analyzed the application's interactions, created an analytics tracking plan and implemented the tracking using Adobe Analytics and Adobe Digital Tag Manager. Using the powerful reporting features in Adobe Analytics, we are able to visualize user interactions in real time at the booth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 4: Success!</h2>
<p>After weeks of development, we are excited to show the new app at Adobe Summit. We will have laptops and Kindle Fire's available to show off the authoring interface and the app. Stop by our booth to see it in person!</p>
