<p>In my previous blog post, I discussed <a href="/blog/2014-08-11/running-axis-1-4-in-aem/">getting Apache Axis 1.4 working in AEM</a>. One of the more interesting things about Axis 1.4 is that it's not easy to log the actual request from the client and response from the server. &nbsp;You can configure the <a href="https://axis.apache.org/axis/java/apiDocs/org/apache/axis/handlers/LogHandler.html" target="_blank">LogHandler</a>, however it is somewhat problematic in AEM to configure due to the classpath complexity in OSGi and it will only log to the system outputstream. &nbsp;This is problematic in AEM as the stdout.log isn't setup by default when runnning in server mode and when running locally will not roll. &nbsp;Intead of this, I would suggest registering a custom SLF4J Log Handler to log the request and response to the AEM SLF4J logs.</p>
<p>To do this, first, add the&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/klcodanr/d5305a7a985876854eee" target="_blank">SLF4JLogHandler</a>&nbsp;to the project, which I adapted from the Apache Axis <a href="https://axis.apache.org/axis/java/apiDocs/org/apache/axis/handlers/LogHandler.html" target="_blank">LogHandler</a>. &nbsp;Next update the code which retrieves the handler port to add the SLF4JLogHandler to handle both requests and responses.</p>

<pre><code>[WS_NAME]Locator locator = new [WS_NAME]Locator();
		
SimpleProvider sp = new SimpleProvider(locator.getEngine().getConfig());
sp.setGlobalRequest(new SLF4JLogHandler());
sp.setGlobalResponse(new SLF4JLogHandler());
locator.setEngineConfiguration(sp);

return locator.get[WS_NAME]WebServiceHandlerPort(wsURL);</code></pre>
		
<p>Once you have this in place, you should see the web service requests and reponses logged to your SLF4J logs.</p>
