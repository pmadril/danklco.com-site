<p>Recently, Adobe introduced <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/aemmobile/2016/02/announcing-adobe-experience-manager-mobile.html?scid=social58257566&amp;adbid=698276895612272640&amp;adbpl=tw&amp;adbpr=846370927" target="_blank">AEM Mobile</a>, a new way to build, maintain and deploy mobile apps. AEM Mobile makes it vastly easier to manage mobile apps by enabling marketers to maintain mobile app content, which has traditionally been done by developers. AEM Mobile is the centerpiece of a new platform&nbsp;Adobe has built around enabling marketing to maintain mobile apps and market to mobile app users.</p>
<p>This new platform is composed of several different technologies, each of which has been deeply integrated to build a seamless mobile app publishing experience.</p>

<h2>Adobe Analytics</h2>
<p>Adobe&nbsp;has created a version of Adobe Analytics specifically targeted at measuring mobile app interactions. Of course, companies can still integrate with Adobe Analytics Standard and Premium to get the full breadth of measurement possibilities, but this mobile-specific framework enables quick and low-effort measurement of a large number of mobile-specific interactions.</p>
