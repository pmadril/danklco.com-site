<p>Recently, Adobe introduced&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/aemmobile/2016/02/announcing-adobe-experience-manager-mobile.html?scid=social58257566&amp;adbid=698276895612272640&amp;adbpl=tw&amp;adbpr=846370927" target="_blank">AEM Mobile</a>, a new way to build, maintain and deploy mobile apps. AEM Mobile makes it vastly easier to manage mobile apps by enabling marketers to maintain mobile app content, which has traditionally been done by developers. AEM Mobile is the centerpiece of a new platform&nbsp;Adobe has built around enabling marketing to maintain mobile apps and market to mobile app users.</p>
<p>This new platform is composed of several different technologies, each of which has been deeply integrated to build a seamless mobile app publishing experience.</p>

<h3>Adobe Digital Publishing Suite</h3>
<p>Adobe Digital Publishing Suite (or DPS), which Adobe unveiled in 2010, provides Marketers the ability to maintain mobile app content without having to involve developers or resubmit apps through the app store. This tool has been used by numerous organizations to manage their apps, however it does have some limits. DPS, does not give full access to the mobile APIs and has limited functionality compared to native apps. Adobe Mobile takes what is best about DPS, the Marketing content management and integrates it into the powerful PhoneGap platform.</p>

<h3>Adobe PhoneGap</h3>
<p>Adobe PhoneGap is a powerful platform for publishing multi-platform mobile apps. These apps are built with HTML and CSS and are wrapped in a native app wrapper. The deep API integrations and powerful rendering engines in modern phones allows these apps to compete in performance and features with native apps without requiring separate development efforts for each platform. By integrating Adobe PhoneGap into AEM Mobile, Adobe has unleashed the power of the PhoneGap platform and integrated with the ease of content publication provided by Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Digital Publishing Suite.</p>

<h3>Adobe Experience Manager</h3>
<p>In AEM Mobile, Adobe Experience Manager extends it's powerful content authoring and Digital Asset Management features to enable marketers to manage and deploy mobile apps through a familiar and intuitive user interface. In AEM Mobile, mobile content authors can use the same drag and drop features to build their mobile app content via reusable components.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Adobe Analytics</h3>
<p>Adobe&nbsp;has created a version of Adobe Analytics specifically targeted at measuring mobile app interactions. Of course, companies can still integrate with Adobe Analytics Standard and Premium to get the full breadth of measurement possibilities, but this mobile-specific framework enables quick and low-effort measurement of a large number of mobile-specific interactions.</p>
