<p>One of the requirements I've been seeing a lot of lately is for distributors or manufacturers to support multiple dealer or branch websites, which are managed at a corporate level and mainained by the branch or dealer. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/enterprise-content-management.html" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Manager</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/administer/sites/msm.html" target="_blank">Live Copy</a>&nbsp;allows authors to manage multiple local sites using Adobe Experience Manager with some content shared between sites and some content unique to particular sites.</p>
<h2>What is Live Copy?</h2>
<p>Live Copy is a feature in Adobe Experience Manager where the content and structure of a source site is copied to target sites via a configurable process. This can either be automatic or manual and can even invoke other processes like automatic publication workflows upon changes to the source site.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive center-block" title="Live Copy in AEM" src="/images/posts/2016-02-23-introduction-adobe-experience-manager-live-copy/Live-Copy-in-AEM.jpg" alt="" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>As shown in the illustration above a source site (or blueprint) contains the base content and structure. The Live Copied sites (Local Branch 1 and Local Branch 2) will receive updates with the shared content which is shown in red. The blue content is created for each individual local site and will not be shared with the blueprint site or the other local sites. This same process can act within a page, allowing authors to add, change or remove pieces of content on a page while preserving the live copy link for the rest of the page content. Live Copies can also be Live Copied allowing the creation of multiple blueprints, for example creating a Plumbing or Electrical focused blueprint versus the default generic blueprint.</p>
<h2>Live Copy Process</h2>
<p>The process for creating a live copy is simple. First an author would log into Adobe Experience Manager and select <code>+ Create</code> &gt;&gt; <code>Create Live Copy</code> from the Sites Manager</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive center-block" title="Creating a Live Copy" src="/images/posts/2016-02-23-introduction-adobe-experience-manager-live-copy/01-create-live-copy.png" alt="/images/posts/2016-02-23-introduction-adobe-experience-manager-live-copy/01-create-live-copy.png" /></p>
<p>Next, the author will select the source or blueprint site:</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/posts/2016-02-23-introduction-adobe-experience-manager-live-copy/02-select-source.png" alt="Select Source" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next the select the destination path:</p>

<p>Finally, they enter the site title, name and rollout configurations:</p>

<p>When the author clicks create, the new site will be created and linked back to the source site via Live Copy. From there the content can be managed similarly to any other AEM content and the authors can choose to override any Live Copied page content via canceling inheritance.</p>

<p>You can find more documentation about Live Copy&nbsp;on the <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/administer/sites/msm.html" target="_blank">Adobe documentation website</a>. If you are facing the problem of managing a large number of similar, but not quite the same websites in Adobe Experience Manager, hopefully this helps you find the solution.</p>
