<p>Millennials became the largest generation in the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/11/millennials-surpass-gen-xers-as-the-largest-generation-in-u-s-labor-force/">workforce early&nbsp;2015</a>. The rise of the Millennials in the workspace will have a profound impact on how companies operate. At the same time, many organizations fail to anticipate how this new generation will change B2B commerce.</p>
<p>Millennials&nbsp;approach&nbsp;information sources differently than previous generations. This, coupled with their increased&nbsp;customer experience&nbsp;expectations&nbsp;presents a challenge for B2B companies.</p>
<h2>Rise of the Millennials</h2>
<p>As shown in the illustration below,&nbsp;over 53 million millennials are in the workforce or 53% of the entire workforce. With Millennials&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/services/consulting/documents/millennials-at-work.pdf">intense focus on moving up the corporate ladder</a>&nbsp;and Baby Boomers moving into retirement, more management and purchasing positions will be held by Millennials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Millennials, having grown up exposed to technology, no longer see technology as an add-on or gimmick. Instead, they expect technology to complement all experiences whether digital or analog. At the same time, Millennials emphasize the human factor, in an era of digitization, providing a humanized, personal experience sets a company apart for millennials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Millennials view technology as a part of the human experience and expect technology to adapt to them rather than adapting to it. This expectation will especially challenge B2B companies which already struggle with digital marketing and especially struggle in providing technology enabled humanized experiences.</p>
<h2>B2B: Laggards in Digital Marketing</h2>
<p>While many B2B companies have made tremendous strides in their digital marketing, many companies still struggle and the industry lags far behind their consumer-facing peers. In a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fiercecmo.com/story/survey-b2b-marketers-struggle-digital-marketing-roi-measurement/2016-03-01">recent survey</a>,&nbsp;70% of digital marketers from B2B companies said:&nbsp;"their organization's digital advertising strategy fails to meet expectations". This is largely is due to the difficulty in gathering quality leads and in accurately measuring the return on digital marketing spend.</p>
<p>This challenge is especially acute in personalizing experiences. B2B companies are <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/05/b2b-buyers-expect-b2c-like-personalization-but-b2b-sellers-struggle/">struggling to deliver personalized experiences</a>, often citing technical challenges. One major challenge&nbsp;B2B marketers often fail to recognize is the challenges caused by the inherent differences in how B2B and B2C companies go to market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the differences for B2B companies is that B2B companies <a href="http://www.demandgenreport.com/industry-topics/content-strategies/2669-b2b-marketers-look-to-personalize-web-content-by-company-industry-and-role.html">personalize based on company and role, rather than individuals</a>. This subtle difference reduces the number of data-points available for personalization and requires a much more careful collection of data to ensure the correct experience is exposed to the correct individual.</p>
<p>Another challenge for B2B companies and personalization is the disconnect between digital experiences and the actual sale. While nearly all B2B buyers research online, most do not purchase through digital platforms, causing companies to struggle to properly attribute leads and properly personalize the experiences of website users.</p>
<h2>Millennials: New Challenges for B2B Marketers</h2>
<p>The rise of millennials threatens to pose an additional challenge, in addition to the challenges B2B companies face in digital marketing. According to a&nbsp;<a href="http://arketi.com/three-generations-survey">recent survey by the Arketi Group</a>, Millennials are in general lean far more heavily on digital experiences especially at the top of the buying funnel, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogs</li>
<li>eBooks</li>
<li>Infographics</li>
<li>Online Ads</li>
<li>Vendor Texts</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
</ul>
<p>Millennials also find traditional B2B sales and marketing channels less effective throughout the buying process, this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyst Reports</li>
<li>Vendor Websites</li>
<li>In-Person Demos and Meetings</li>
<li>Phone Calls</li>
<li>Product brochures, datasheets, sales literature</li>
<li>Trade shows and conferences</li>
<li>Whitepapers</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly a few patterns emerge when looking at what different methods millennials prefer for B2B marketing. Millennials prefer channels&nbsp;which are digital and social,&nbsp;whereas, in-person, print, and traditional channels&nbsp;are their least preferred.</p>
<p>This poses a challenge as nearly all of the channels identified by B2B marketers&nbsp;are among the list of millennials least preferred channels. In a recent survey, B2B marketers indicated <a href="http://www.regalix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/State-of-B2B-Marketing-2015.pdf">they saw the following channels as the most effective</a>&nbsp;in reaching their goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Events (exhibitions, conferences, trade shows etc) 84%</li>
<li>Print Media 13%</li>
<li>Direct Mail 22%</li>
<li>Outdoor Ads 6%</li>
<li>Television 4%</li>
<li>Radio 4%</li>
</ul>
<p>If B2B companies do not evolve their marketing to better serve millennial workers' desires and expectations, millennials will leave for competitors who are better able to market effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>B2B Digital Marketing for Millennials</h2>
<p>So how do B2B marketers effectively market to millennials?</p>
<p>First, B2B marketers need to lay a foundation for excellent digital marketing experiences. This means eliminating data silos, developing customer 360 profiles and building a strong platform,&nbsp;with an effective implementation team and modern technical platform.&nbsp;</p>
