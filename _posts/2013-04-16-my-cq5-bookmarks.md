I'm pretty sparing with bookmarks, however there are a few pages I use just about every day for my job developing for Adobe CQ5. &nbsp;I have these daily use bookmarks in my bookmarks toolbar. &nbsp;They are:

#### [CQ Toggle][1]

Actually, this is a bookmarklet, but it allows me to easily switch between editing more and a more 'real' preview mode.

#### [CQ Widgets API][2]

A must have for dialog development. &nbsp;Documents the available dialog widgets as well as the CQ JavaScript API. &nbsp;Combine this with firebug and you have everything you need to develop client side code for CQ.

#### [JSTL JavaDoc][3]

I'm always forgetting the attribute names when using JSLT, very useful when developing server-side code.

#### [CQ Java API][4]

Links to the various Java APIs used to create Adobe CQ. &nbsp;Must have for developing server-side code. &nbsp;

### How about you?

What links have you bookmarked? &nbsp;What links do you use every day? &nbsp;
