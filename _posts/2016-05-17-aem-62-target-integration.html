<p><a href="http://janrain.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/online-consumers-fed-up-with-irrelevant-content-on-favorite-websites-according-to-janrain-study/" target="_blank">Consumers want relevant content</a>, however many brands have difficulty prroviding sufficiently relevant and personalized content. One reason for this is the disconnect between the authoring experiences for website and personalized content, because the personalized content is often managed in separate tools. This disconnect causes confusion for authors and duplicate work as authors must log into multiple systems to maintain site content.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/release-notes.html">latest release</a> of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/enterprise-content-management.html">Adobe Experience Manager</a>, Adobe's flagship Experience Management product, Adobe has vastly simplified the process for authoring personalized content. In addition to some <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/digital-marketing/adobe-experience-manager-6-2-new-features/">exciting new features</a>, this release includes a new integration with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/testing-targeting.html">Adobe Target</a>.&nbsp;This new integration seamlessly connects both products, allowing authors to maintain both standard&nbsp;and personalized website content within a single interface.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/personalization/personalization-payoff-roi-getting-personal/">clear benefits of personalization and optimization</a>&nbsp;and the improvements Adobe has made to the AEM / Target integration, more Adobe customers should consider personalizing their site content. </p>
<h2>Authoring Personalized Experiences with&nbsp;AEM &amp; Target</h2>
<p>While at Adobe Summit, I attended the Lab <em>"Integrating Experience Manager with Adobe Analytics, Target and DTM"</em>, this lab showed the new integration between AEM and Target. In only one hour, we were able to set up all the integration and personalize content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, I'll show the process for authoring personalized content in AEM with Adobe Target. For more information on setting up or configuring the AEM / Target integration, please see the <a href="https://adobesummit.lanyonevents.com/2016/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1462">Summit Session documents</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Configure an&nbsp;Activity in AEM</h3>
<p>The first step to using Adobe Target in AEM is to configure your Activity. An activity is an instance of targeting on a page. Each activity gets a name and you can configure which targeting engine, configuration and targeting type to use.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive centeralign center-block" src="/images/posts/2016-05-18-aem-62-target-integration/02-Configure-Activity.png" alt="Configuring an Activity" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a new Activity, first, select the Brand (which is a container of activities for a particular brand or site) and then click the + button. If you wanted to modify an existing activity, you would select the name of&nbsp;activity from the drop-down.</p>
<h3>2. Define Targets</h3>
<p>Next, define the components to be targeted. You can define any number of components to be targeted on the page. To do so, simply select the Targeting icon on the component's edit bar while in targeting mode.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive centeralign center-block" src="/images/posts/2016-05-18-aem-62-target-integration/03-Manage-Audiences.png" alt="Managing Audiences" /></p>
<p>AEM will automatically replace the existing components with a targeting component and make the existing content the default content.</p>
<h3>3. Create&nbsp;Experiences</h3>
<p>Once you have your components selected for the Activity, you need to create the experiences. Experiences are content variants shown to a particular audience or are groups of users based on criteria. By default, only the DEFAULT experience&nbsp;will be displayed when the Activity is first created.</p>
<p>To add an experience, select "+ Add Experience Targeting". This will allow you to choose from among the pre-defined audiences or create a new audience to target.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive centeralign center-block" src="/images/posts/2016-05-18-aem-62-target-integration/04-Choose-Audience.png" alt="Choosing Audiences" width="600" height="184" /></p>
<p>You can create any number of audiences and order them in order in which they will be selected by Target.</p>
<h3>4. Create the Experience Content</h3>
<p>Once you've defined the experiences, select each one and update the content in the targeted components for the experience. You can change content, images or anything else you can edit within an AEM component.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive centeralign center-block" src="/images/posts/2016-05-18-aem-62-target-integration/07-Create-Experience-Content.png" alt="Create the Experience Content" width="600" height="374" /></p>
<p>You can quickly switch between experiences in authoring mode by selecting the experience name on the right to see how the content appears in each experience.</p>
<h3>5. Finish and Publish</h3>
<p>Once you have created the content for the experiences, review and finish the setup of the Activity.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2016-05-18-aem-62-target-integration/08-Finish-Configuration.png" alt="Finish Configuration" width="600" height="374" /></p>
<p>From this screen, you can define how reporting will be tracked&nbsp;for the Activity as well as the goals for the Activity. This will allow marketers to determine the success of a personalization&nbsp;activity or which variant of content performs best.</p>
<p>Once you have verified and finished the Activity, publish the page to push the changes to the live website. The publication&nbsp;process will ensure all content is published to the live site simultaneously to ensure website consistency.</p>
<h2>Bonus: Testing Experiences</h2>
<p>To ensure your targeting is working correctly, AEM includes the ability to view and modify the Client Context. The Client Context stores data on the current user and can / should be used for configuring segments inside AEM and Target. To view the Client Context, switch to Preview mode in AEM and then select the Client Context Hub icon. This will allow you to modify the variables in the client context and switch between segments to see the different experiences.</p>

<h2>Personalization Unleashed</h2>
<p>By eliminating&nbsp;the barriers to authoring and maintaining personalized content, Adobe is enabling organizations to delight their customers by providing rich, personalized experiences without requiring the overhead and cost of maintaining content in multiple systems.</p>
