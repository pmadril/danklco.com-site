<p>We're now down to the last few days before Adobe Summit starts on March 22<sup>nd</sup> and I'm already getting my bags packed.</p>
<p>This year, I'm bringing something new: <strong>a video camera!</strong> Every day, I'll be sharing a video of my thoughts, insights and views on what I've learned at Adobe Summit. Joining me will be a collection of my colleagues, comerades and partners.</p>
<p>I'll be posting at least one video a day for the duration of Adobe Summit, so make sure to stay tuned in to get the freshest scoop of industry insights, reactions and the latest news from Adobe Summit.</p>
