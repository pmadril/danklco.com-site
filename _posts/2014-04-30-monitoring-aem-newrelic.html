<p>I love <a href="https://www.newrelic.com/" target="_blank">New Relic</a>. &nbsp;Their server monitoring tools allow me to remotely monitor my various servers and development applications for free and their stuff just works. &nbsp;Recently, we were running into an issue at Six Dimensions where a couple of our development servers were toppling over and without any real monitoring in place we couldn't tell why. &nbsp;To address this, we've been rolling out New Relic on all of our development servers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this, I was curious about setting up monitoring of Adobe CQ / AEM with New Relic. &nbsp;Out of the box, New Relic supports <a href="http://newrelic.com/java" target="_blank">a number of application servers</a>, however AEM is not one of them. Luckly, I found a pretty simple guide to setting up monitoring generic Java applications. &nbsp;Here are the instructions for setting up basic montioring for AEM in New Relic:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> First login to New Relic, go to the <em>Applications</em> page and click <em>Add more</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Next, ensure Java is selected from the language dropdown and click <em>Reveal your license key</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Upload the zip to your server and put it inside the CQ installation folder</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Unzip the archive and edit the file newrelic/newrelic.yaml, setting the property <em>app_name</em> to an appropriate value.&nbsp; The <em>app_name</em> should contain the client/application name, environment and instance type, ex: <em>Client DEV Author</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Edit the CQ start script at crx-quickstart/bin/start[.bat], add the value <em>-javaagent:[CQ_ROOT]/newrelic/newrelic.jar</em> to the default JVM options, ex:</p>
<pre><code>
# default JVM options
if [ -z "$CQ_JVM_OPTS" ]; then
     CQ_JVM_OPTS='-server -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024M -Djava.awt.headless=true -javaagent:/opt/aem/author/newrelic/newrelic.jar'
fi
</code>
</pre>
<p><strong>Step 6 -</strong> Restart CQ and wait for a few minutes for the application to appear in the New Relic console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once monitoring is started you should be able to leverage the reports provided by New Relic to monitor and diagnose your CQ instances.</p>
