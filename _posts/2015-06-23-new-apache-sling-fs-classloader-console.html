<p>In AEM 6.1, the default repository based ClassLoader was replaced with the new FSClassLoader (File System ClassLoader). &nbsp;This ClassLoader offers higher performance and throughput, however it removes a valuable tool for developers to debug errors in JSP scripts. In previous versions of AEM, developers could navigate to /var/classes and drill down through the heirarchy to find the Java file generated from&nbsp;the JSP scripts. In AEM 6.1, as the class and java files are now stored in the filesystem, this is no longer possible.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Surprised ! Since AEM 6.1 no more compiled JSP files in /var/classes <a href="https://t.co/JYJr7yPiZP">https://t.co/JYJr7yPiZP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AEM6?src=hash">#AEM6</a></p>

<p>Currently, to find the appropriate files, you will need to locate the bundle ID for the FSClassLoader bundle, then the java files will be located at:</p>
<p><code>[AEM_INSTALL_DIR]/crx-quickstart/launchpad/felix/bundle[BUNDLE_ID]/data/classes</code></p>
<p>Obviously, this is significantly more difficult than the previous method. After pondering this for a bit, I created a new OSGi Console plugin. &nbsp;This plugin is available as a download in the bundle Commons FileSystem ClassLoader version 1.0.2&nbsp;from the Apache Sling website:</p>
<p><a href="http://sling.apache.org/downloads.cgi">http://sling.apache.org/downloads.cgi</a></p>
<p>The new plugin lists all of the Java files currently generated from the JSPs:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And allows you to view a specific Java file (as well as downloading the .class and .deps files):</p>

<p>Hopefully this new OSGi console&nbsp;will be helpful for anyone developing JSPs in AEM 6.1!</p>
